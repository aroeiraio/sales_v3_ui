### Phase 3: Simplify Services ‚è≥ Pending

**Goal**: Refactor services to work with route-based architecture

#### Step 3.1: Simplify Payment Service
- [ ] Remove complex state management from PaymentService
- [ ] Keep only API call methods
- [ ] Remove state change callbacks
- [ ] Update payment initialization methods

#### Step 3.2: Update Cart Service integration
- [ ] Update cart service navigation
- [ ] Ensure cart persistence during payment flow
- [ ] Test cart clearing on successful payment

#### Step 3.3: Create Navigation Service

- [ ] Handle browser back/forward navigation
- [ ] Add payment flow state persistence

#### Step 3.4: Update Session Management
- [ ] Ensure session timeout works across payment routes
- [ ] Update session extension for payment interactions
- [ ] Test session timeout during payment flows

---

### Phase 4: Migration & Cleanup ‚è≥ Pending

**Goal**: Complete migration and remove old code

#### Step 4.1: Update existing routes
- [ ] Simplify `/checkout` route to cart review only
- [ ] Update navigation from `/cart` to `/payment/method-selection`

### Files Created ‚úÖ

#### Phase 1 - Route Structure & Components:
- `/src/routes/payment/+layout.svelte` - Shared payment layout
- `/src/routes/payment/+layout.ts` - Route guards and data loading
- `/src/routes/payment/method-selection/+page.svelte` - Payment method selection page
- `/src/routes/payment/processing/+page.svelte` - Payment processing page
- `/src/lib/components/payment/PaymentHeader.svelte` - Payment header component

### Issues Encountered
*(None yet - will document as we encounter them)*

### Solutions Applied
*(Will document solutions as they're implemented)*

## üìà Metrics

### Before Refactoring
- **Checkout page size**: 2,497 lines
- **Payment states in single file**: 8+ states
- **Timer management**: 5+ timers in one component
- **Cyclomatic complexity**: Very high (unmaintainable)

### Target After Refactoring
- **Average page size**: ~200-400 lines per route
- **Payment states per file**: 1 state per route
- **Timer management**: 1 timer per relevant route
- **Cyclomatic complexity**: Low (easily maintainable)

## üîÑ Next Actions

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Create payment directory structure** - Set up the foundation
2. **Create payment layout component** - Shared UI for all payment routes  
3. **Create first payment route** - Start with method selection as it's the entry point

## üéâ Phase 1 Complete!

**Completed**: 2025-09-13 22:00  
**Status**: ‚úÖ All Phase 1 objectives achieved

### What's Working:
- ‚úÖ New payment route structure at `/payment/*`
- ‚úÖ Shared layout with progress steps
- ‚úÖ Payment method selection page
- ‚úÖ Processing page with auto-navigation
- ‚úÖ Reusable payment components
- ‚úÖ Dev server compiles without errors

### Ready for Testing:
You can now navigate to:
- `http://localhost:8092/payment/method-selection` - To see payment method selection
- `http://localhost:8092/payment/processing` - To see processing state

### Next Steps:
- **Phase 2**: Extract remaining payment flows (PIX, card, success, etc.)
- **Phase 3**: Simplify payment service
- **Phase 4**: Migration and cleanup
