Checkout Screen UI: From Cart Screen to Checkout Screen

Now you are integrating the sales API.

We are working on the **Checkout Screen** of a PoS interface. Follow these rules carefully:


For success message, show nothing.
For failure message, show a dialog with message content and a close button.

* Screen in portrait HD or Full HD
