Payment Screen UI (Checkout â†’ Payment Flow)

We are implementing the **Payment Screen** of a **PoS interface**.
The UI must call the **sales API** and react correctly to returned statuses.
Follow the **flows, messages, and transitions** carefully.


Animate success message with green circular background diminishing end show in the end success icon (in white color).
Animate unsuccess message with red circular background diminishing end show in the end failure icon (in white color).

        |---> Card (Credit/Debit)
        |         |
        |         â†’ WAIT (idle)

        |           â””â”€â”€ SHOW_RETRY (PAYMENT_REFUSED) â†’ [Payment Refused Screen]
        |                       |-- Retry? Yes â†’ back to Checkout
        |                       |-- Retry? No â†’ End Screen (with sorry message all payments tries failed, try another time)
        |
        |---> Pix

âœ… Deliverable:
Implement **UI screens and transitions** exactly as mapped in the unified diagram.
Each API response dictates the **next UI state**.

Would you like me to also **split the unified diagram into a swimlane version** (separate lanes for *Card* vs *Pix*) so Claude can clearly see both flows side by side?
