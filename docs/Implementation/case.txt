Develop a case for a USB device.

The USB device has a circuit board with 50 x 33 mm.
Each border has a followed constraint:
A - 33 mm - a USB connector of 12.1mm in the center (10.6 mm of each corner). 15mm of USB connector is out of this board.
B - 50 mm - a screw terminal block of 29.7 x 7,7 mm positioned from C to A 
C - 33 mm - a 5-pin header of 15mm located on the center having a 1.5mm of space among screw terminal block
D - 50 mm - a screw terminal block of 29.7 x 7,7 mm positioned from C to A followed by a 2,6mm of space and 3-pin header of 7,5mm

In the corner of AB and AD there are two holes of 3.2mm and 1mm padding. The roles is intended to be used to enforce case.

The case must expose the pins and screw terminal block, also the USB connector.

PCB dimensions:

50 mm × 33 mm × 1.6 mm

Each

Side A (short side, 33 mm):

USB connector, 12.1 x 4.4 mm wide, centered. Connector extends 15 mm outside the board.

Side B (long side, 50 mm, between corners C → A):
Screw terminal block, 29.7 mm × 7.7 mm, flush with edge, starting from corner C toward A.

Side C (short side, 33 mm):
5-pin header, 15 mm wide, centered.
Keep 1.5 mm clearance from the screw terminal block on side B.

Side D (long side, 50 mm, between corners C → A):
Screw terminal block, 29.7 mm × 7.7 mm, flush with edge, starting from corner C toward A.
Followed by a 2.6 mm gap, then a 3-pin header, 7.5 mm wide.

Mounting holes:
Two holes, 3.2 mm diameter, placed at corners AB and AD, inset with 1 mm padding from both X and Y edges.

Intended for screws to secure the case halves.

Case requirements:
Internal clearance above PCB: ~12–15 mm.

Must expose:

USB connector (side A).
Screw terminal blocks (sides B and D).
5-pin and 3-pin headers (sides C and D).
Two-part design (top + bottom shell) recommended, with mounting holes aligned.
